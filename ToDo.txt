Format:
	Tracking Data
		TIME (VECTOR3 QUATERNION) * n
	Sensor Data
		TIME EDA ECG DELTATIME

->
	Input (Player only)
		(VECTOR3 QUATERNION) * n
	Output
		EDA ECG

Problems:
	1) TIME (Tracking) != TIME (Sensor)
	2) measurement errors
	3) 2) -> Data is async
	4) Data has to be synchronised

Solutions:
	1a) map Tracking onto Sensor
			precision in Sensor Data is important because otherwise heart beats could be missed
			Problem: how should the mapping be done without Sensor Data (learned network)
	1b) accentuate heart beats
			in this way the time from Tracking Data can be used
			measurement errors could be masked by inserting "fake" heart beats
			EDA Data can easily be smoothed
	2a) fix with 1b)
	3a) fix with 1b)
	3b) estimate correct data
			Problem: possibly incorrect
	4a) send start & end message to Sensor Unit
			fix start delay by cutting the beginning off of the tracking data (same for end but this time cut sensor data)
	4b) somehow get correct start time
			Problem: I don't know if the Arduino can do this
	4c) start and end at the same time (using Unity)

Result:
	1b)
	2a)
	3a)
	4c)
